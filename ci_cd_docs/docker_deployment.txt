Docker Deployment Best Practices

1. Use multi-stage builds to keep image sizes small.
2. Avoid storing secrets in Dockerfiles.
3. Tag images properly with version numbers.
4. Use health checks for containers.
5. Leverage Docker Compose for local testing.

To deploy:
- Build image: `docker build -t myapp:latest .`
- Run container: `docker run -d -p 80:80 myapp:latest`
